  Currently a student in this Data Science Bootcamp (obviously!) Employed as a customer service representative for a manufacturing company. Previously worked in data entry, financial reconciliation, and criminal background checks. I have also done some ghostwriting.

  I enjoy cooking, baking, drawing, writing, crocheting, and doing a myriad of other crazy, creative activities. Sometimes I cosplay!
